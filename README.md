## Introduction

`algopractice` is a repository containing my personal solutions to a range of problems I've tackled on platforms like LeetCode and other DSA challenges. This repo aims to help fellow coders in their journey to master the intricacies of algorithms and data structures.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nmchenry01/algopractice.git
cd algopractice
```

## Usage

Each problem is stored in its own directory with a descriptive name. Inside the directory, you'll find the problem description and the solution(s).

For example:

```text
├── algopractice
│   ├── two-sum
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   ├── longest-substring-without-repeating-characters
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── solution.py

```
